# M-Extension-Server — headless Mihon (Tachiyomi)/Aniyomi extensions server

M-Extension-Server is a lightweight, headless service for running Mihon (Tachiyomi)/Aniyomi extensions (APKs). It dynamically loads extensions from Base64-encoded APKs, executes catalogue and content methods (manga/anime), and returns results via a small HTTP API.
